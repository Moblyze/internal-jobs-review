Ce département est responsable de l'ingénierie des pipelines sous-marins et des systèmes de raccordement pour les projets de construction offshore.\n\nDans les systèmes de pipelines sous-marins, et plus particulièrement au niveau de l'extrémité du pipeline (PLET), il est essentiel d'évaluer la distance entre la bride d'ancrage et le fond marin, surtout lorsque le PLET est situé à une profondeur importante. Cette analyse permet de s'assurer que la conduite n'est pas soumise à des contraintes excessives.\n\n \n\nPour garantir une conception sûre en termes de résistance et de fatigue, une enveloppe admissible est définie. Cette enveloppe délimite les angles et les élévations acceptables pour la bride d'ancrage, assurant ainsi que les charges et les dommages dus à la fatigue restent dans les limites admissibles.\n\nChaque point de cette enveloppe correspond à une analyse par éléments finis (EF) où l'intégrité du pipeline ou les dommages dus à la fatigue atteignent le seuil admissible.\n\nActuellement, ce processus est manuel et repose sur une méthode empirique pour identifier les limites critiques. Le modèle EF utilisé partage les mêmes hypothèses et données d'entrée que le modèle global utilisé pour l'analyse de la rugosité de fond.\n\n \n\nCe stage vise à étudier comment simplifier le modèle EF actuel sans compromettre sa précision ainsi qu’à automatiser la génération de l'enveloppe admissible, éliminant ainsi les itérations manuelles et améliorant l'efficacité de la conception.\n\n \n\nVos principales responsabilités seront les suivantes :\n\n \n\nExaminer et analyser le modèle EF actuel utilisé pour la génération de l'enveloppe.\nIdentifier les possibilités de simplification du modèle tout en conservant des résultats fiables.\nConcevoir et mettre en œuvre un processus automatisé pour générer l'enveloppe admissible.\nDévelopper des scripts ou des outils pour exécuter des simulations et compiler les résultats de manière autonome.\nValider l'approche automatisée en la comparant aux méthodes manuelles existantes.\nDocumenter la méthodologie et formuler des recommandations pour son intégration dans les flux de travail d'ingénierie.\nWhat experience would we like you to have?\nÉtudiant(e) en dernière année d'école d'ingénieurs ou en master spécialisé en génie mécanique, génie offshore ou modélisation numérique\nMaîtrise de l'analyse par éléments finis (par exemple, Abaqus, Ansys ou équivalent)\nCompétences en programmation (Python, MATLAB ou équivalent) pour l'automatisation et le traitement des données\nIntérêt pour les systèmes offshore, l'analyse de la fatigue et l'intégrité structurale\nEsprit analytique, autonomie et proactivité dans la résolution de problèmes\nAnglais courant obligatoire (langue de travail de l'équipe)\n\n \n\nLocation\n\nLe stage est basé à Bois-Colombes (92).\n\n \n\nDuration\n\n6 mois\n\n \n\nVous souhaitez travailler dans un environnement multiculturel où la diversité et l’inclusion ne sont pas que des mots et participer de l’intérieur au défi passionnant de la transition énergétique ? Envoyez-nous votre candidature !\n\n \n\nSubsea7 est fier d'être un employeur qui respecte l'égalité des chances et qui recrute tous les talents sans distinction de race, de genre, de religion, d’origine, d’orientation sexuelle, de handicap ou d’âge.",
