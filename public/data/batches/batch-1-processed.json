It requires a holistic, systematic approach to design one that considers reservoir performance, subsurface behavior, flow assurance boundaries, system operability, environmental conditions, constructability, design life, intervention needs, and eventual decommissioning. By integrating these parameters, we create subsea solutions that maximize value and minimize risk across the full project lifecycle.\n\nFuel your passion\n\nAs a Lead Front End Engineer you will work within a multidisciplinary environment to guide early‑phase engineering and field development studies. You will partner with product experts, lead trade‑off evaluations, and provide systems‑level direction across projects and technology programs. You will take ownership of cost, schedule, quality, and HS&E performance for the studies you deliver, while contributing to process improvements and ensuring smooth transitions into tendering and execution phases. You will also support regional sales and commercial teams, providing technical expertise during early customer engagement to help secure successful project awards.\n\nAs a Lead Front End Engineer, you will be responsible for:\n\nLeading project engineering for system definition and layout from feasibility and concept definition through to FEED.\n\nDeveloping subsea field concepts and optimizing system architecture across the full lifecycle including design, manufacturing, installation, commissioning, operability, and decommissioning.\n\nProviding voice‑of‑customer input to R&D initiatives, field optimization activities, and hardware design reviews.\n\nDefining and managing interfaces across Baker Hughes’ global product teams, delivery partners, and client organizations.\n\nReporting engineering progress, technical issues, and interface matters in project meetings and progress reports.\n\nSupporting study managers with technical interfaces, change control, variations, and overall scope delivery.\n\nProviding technical leadership on studies, projects, and assigned tasks.\n\nTo be successful in this role you will:\n\nHold a Master’s degree or a bachelor’s degree with demonstrable industry experience (experience with Oil & Gas operators, subsea equipment manufacturers, SURF contractors, or offshore renewables is desirable but not essential).\n\nDemonstrate strong interpersonal and communication skills, both verbal and written.\n\nHave broad knowledge of project and engineering management processes, systems engineering, and decision‑analysis frameworks (INCOSE, AACE, APM, or PRINCE2 desirable but not essential).\n\nBring proven experience in project engineering within a multidisciplinary environment.\n\nKnowledge in design and selection across one or more of the following: field architecture, flow assurance, process engineering, Subsea Production Systems, risers, flowlines and pipelines, control systems, constructability, or installation.\n\nBe available for international travel for customer meetings, project needs, and short‑term assignments.\n\nBe based in London, Aberdeen, Bristol, or Florence, with flexible working options considered.\n\nNote: No relocation assistance is provided.\n\nWork in a way that works for you\n\nWe recognize that everyone is different and that the way in which people want to work and deliver at their best is different for everyone too.
